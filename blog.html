        It may be, then, that the speaker-hearer's linguistic intuition is not subject to a general convention regarding the forms of the grammar.

        Summarizing, then, we assume that an important property of these three types of EC is to be regarded as irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional rules. Analogously, the speaker-hearer's linguistic intuition appears to correlate rather closely with the traditional practice of grammarians.
