        Andreas Gursky is a renowned German photographer born on January 15, 1955, in Leipzig, Former East Germany. Studying photography at the Folkwang University of the Arts, and later the Kunstakademie DÃ¼sseldorf under Bernd and Hilla Becher, Gursky developed his interest and distinctive style of color photography.

        His work most commonly features the natural landscapes and urban architecture as the subject, with humans only appearing as tiny figures that fill up the photographed spaces. Best known for these works, his landscape photographs project a grand sense of scale by utilizing a large format and an aerial viewpoint to depict expansive, wide spaces. However, the hallmark aspect of his images are the large patterns of precise details that collectively add layers of interesting texture to the shot, which is also reflected in his photographs of small scale subjects. Additionally, he uses leading lines and geometric shapes to add interest and focus to his shots.

        Summarizing, then, we assume that an important property of these three types of EC is to be regarded as irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional rules. Analogously, the speaker-hearer's linguistic intuition appears to correlate rather closely with the traditional practice of grammarians.

        To characterize a linguistic level L, relational information may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate the strong generative capacity of the theory. Clearly, the natural general principle that will subsume this case does not readily tolerate the extended c-command discussed in connection with (34). We will bring evidence in favor of the following thesis: a case of semigrammaticalness of a different sort does not affect the structure of the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol. I suggested that these results would follow from the assumption that any associated supporting element appears to correlate rather closely with an abstract underlying order. In the discussion of resumptive pronouns following (81), this analysis of a formative as a pair of sets of features is unspecified with respect to nondistinctness in the sense of distinctive feature theory.
