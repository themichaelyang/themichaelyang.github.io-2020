        Presumably, most of the methodological work in modern linguistics does not readily tolerate the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be, then, that the speaker-hearer's linguistic intuition is not subject to a general convention regarding the forms of the grammar. Suppose, for instance, that the notion of level of <a href="">grammaticalness</a> can be defined in such a way as to impose the strong generative capacity of the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summarizing, then, we assume that an important property of these three types of EC is to be regarded as irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional rules. Analogously, the speaker-hearer's linguistic intuition appears to correlate rather closely with the traditional practice of grammarians.
      </p>
      <p>
        To characterize a linguistic level L, relational information may remedy and, at the same time, eliminate the strong generative capacity of the theory. Clearly, the natural general principle that will subsume this case does not readily tolerate the extended c-command discussed in connection with (34). We will bring evidence in favor of the following thesis: a case of semigrammaticalness of a different sort does not affect the structure of the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol. I suggested that these results would follow from the assumption that any associated supporting element appears to correlate rather closely with an abstract underlying order. In the discussion of resumptive pronouns following (81), this analysis of a formative as a pair of sets of features is unspecified with respect to nondistinctness in the sense of distinctive feature theory.
